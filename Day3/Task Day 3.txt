-----
Xpath is defined as XML path
it is a syntax for finding anyelement on webpage using XML path expression
Xpath is used to find the location of any element on webpage using HTML DOM structure
Xpath can be used to navigate through element and attributes in DOM
Xpath is an address of the element


Diffrent between Absolute & relative Xpaths
1) Absolute Xpath starts from root HTML node
   Relative Xpath directly jump to element on DOM

2) Absolute Xpath start with /
   Relative Xpath start with //

3) in Absolute Xpath we use only tags/nodes
   in Relative Xpath we use attributes.

syntax of writting relative Xpath
-------
//tagname[@attribute='value']

//input[@id='small-searchterms']
//*[@id='small-searchterm']


reason to prefer relative Xpath
1) If developer inroduced new element then absolute Xpath will broken
2) If developer change the element then absolute Xpath will broken

absolute Xpath is unstable....
